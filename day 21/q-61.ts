// Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums,
//  and show one 
enum Vehiclestype  {
    car ,
    motorcycle,
    buses,
    truck
}
// Showing one type of vehicle from the list
console.log(Vehiclestype.buses) ; 
 // It shows 2 because enums start counting from 0
// Here, we're just checking what number the Car category got in our list.
